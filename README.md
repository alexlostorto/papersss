Welcome to **Papersss**! ðŸŽ‰

As a Year 11 student, I have done an abundance of past papers (just ask my teachers!) and searching for past papers soon became pretty obnoxious. I realised that AQA conveniently stores their PDF's with a specific URL format, making it very easy to change specific parameters and retrieve the corresponding file - this means that there is no scraping or database of files from my end!

Click [**here**](https://alexlostorto.github.io/papersss/) to visit the **Papersss** website and search for past papers.

```python
# Available past papers
class PastPapers:
  def fetch_subjects(self):
    return ["Mathematics"]

  def fetch_exam_boards(self):
    return ["AQA"]

  def fetch_type(self):
    return ["Question paper", "Mark scheme"]
```

## âš¡ Quick setup

1. Visit [**Papersss**](https://alexlostorto.github.io/papersss/) and fill out each field.
2. Click _'Search'_ to retrieve the PDF.
3. Star the repo ðŸ˜„
